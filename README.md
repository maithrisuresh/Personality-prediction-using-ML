# Personality-prediction-using-ML
Project idea:
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a personality type system that divides a person into 16 distinct personalities based on introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving capabilities. We can identify the personality of a person from the type of posts they put on social media.

I have downloaded the dataset from :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type.

I have used NLP(Natural Language processing ) for this project .

I have created a blog that explains each and every steps : https://maithrisuresh.github.io/

Let's see what is  Myers Briggs Type Indicator?

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katherine Briggs, to identify an individual’s personality type among 16 possibilities.
The MBTI classifies individuals into one of 16 personality types. These types arise from four dimensions that consist of two categories each. The test sorts people into one category in each dimension based on their answers to a series of either/or questions. The four dimensions are combined to create one’s personality type.
The goal of the MBTI is to enable people to learn more about who they are and what that means for their preferences in different areas of life, such as work and relationships. As a result, each of the 16 personality types identified by the test are considered equal—one isn't better than another.
Three of the dimensions utilized by the MBTI are adapted from Jung’s work, while a fourth was added by Briggs and Myers. Those four dimensions are:

Extroversion (E) versus Introversion (I). As Jung specified, this dimension is indicative of the attitude of the individual. Extroverts are outward looking and oriented to the exterior world, while introverts are inward looking and oriented to their subjective inner-workings

Sensing (S) versus Intuition (N). This dimension focuses on the way people take in information. Sensing types are interested in what’s real. They enjoy using their senses to learn and focus on facts. Intuitive types are more interested in impressions. They think abstractly and enjoy imagining possibilities.

Thinking (T) versus Feeling (F). This dimension builds on the sensing and intuition functions to determine how one acts on the information they’ve taken in. Those who emphasize thinking focus on facts, data, and logic to make decisions. In contrast, those who emphasize feeling focus on people and emotions to make decisions.

Judging (J) versus Perceiving (P). This final dimension was added to the MBTI by Briggs and Myers as a way to determine if a person tends to make rational or irrational judgments when interacting with the world. A judging person relies on structure and makes definitive decisions, but a perceiving person is open and adaptable.

Sixteen Personality Types:
The four dimensions yield 16 personality types, each of which is supposed to be different and distinctive. Each type is described by a four-letter code. For example, an ISTJ is introverted, sensing, thinking, and judging, and an ENFP is extroverted, intuitive, feeling, and perceiving. One’s type is considered immutable and the categories an individual falls into based on the MBTI are thought to dominate a person’s personality.

They are : ISTJ , ISTP , INTP , ESTP , ISFP , ISFJ , INTJ , ESTJ , INFP , INFJ , ESFP , ENFP , ESFJ , ENTP , ENTJ , ENFJ
